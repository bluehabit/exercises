## Problem

Found something interesting today while getting a div to follow my mouse cursor using mousemove event listener. If you scroll down in your browser while the div is following it will only follow on the x axis, the y axis will still be where you were prior to scrolling. 

I guess this is intended https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/Scroll-linked_effects

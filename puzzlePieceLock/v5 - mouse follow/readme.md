The puzzle piece will now follow the mouse cursor precisly, you can no longer move so fast such that you lose the peice. 
Before `mousemove` was on the **individual puzzle piece**. Now, its looking for `mousemove` on the browser **window**. When `mousemove` was on the individual puzzle piece it would sometimes cause the user to drop the piece if they moved their mouse to fast.
